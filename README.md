# Appium Test Automation Framework

A lightweight Java-based automation framework for Android apps using **Appium**, **TestNG**, and **Page Object Model (POM)**. Designed for **sequential test execution**, with no parallel or thread-local setup. Tested on General Store demo app.


## Features

- Appium + TestNG integration
- Page Object Model design pattern
- Centralised driver management
- Rich gesture support: scroll, tap, swipe, long press, drag-drop
- Supports form validation, product flow, and cart verification
- APK bundled locally for ease of setup

appium --address 127.0.0.1 --port 4723
```
### 2. Run via Maven:
```bash
mvn test
```
### 3. Or via TestNG Suite:
```bash
Right-click on sanity-suite.xml â†’ Run As â†’ TestNG Suite
```

## Test Scenarios
Sample test cases include:
- Filling and submitting a form (TestFormPage)
- Adding products to cart and verifying price (TestProductPage)
- Validating terms & conditions modal
- Total checkout amount accuracy

All test methods are located in the Tests package.
